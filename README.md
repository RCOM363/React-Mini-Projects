# React-Mini-Projects

Welcome to my React Mini Projects Repository! This is where I store all the small projects I've built while learning React from YouTube tutorials. These projects are simple but effective in helping me grasp various React concepts and improve my skills.

## Projects

- [Accordion](https://github.com/RCOM363/React-Mini-Projects/tree/main/accordion#readme)
- [Color Palette Generator](https://github.com/RCOM363/React-Mini-Projects/tree/main/colorPaletteGenerator#readme)

## Getting Started

To run any of these projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory you're interested in: cd project-name
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Start the development server: npm run dev
5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000/ to view the project.
